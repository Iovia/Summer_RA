    - Using Git
        - Git Tutorial: https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/
        - Set up with Github
        - Clone: https://github.com/Baxter-Robinson/FakeCEEDD.git
        - Please check-in and check-out every time you start and finish work


- To Do
    - Read Documentation/Grant-Application.pdf for context
    - Clean Data
        - Rename names to be more intuitive
        - Maybe create some subfiles for ease
    - Graphs and Tables
        - Table: Descriptive Statistics: Occupation, Capital Income Level, Labour Income Level, Age of Business 
        - Graph: Selection into entrepreneurship
            - X: Deciles of capital income, Deciles of labour income, Deciles of total income
            - Y: Probability of transitioning into Entrepreneurship/ Proportion of Entrepreneurs/ Average employment of firms/ 5 year survival rate
        - Event Study Graph
            - X-axis: Time around business formation {-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3}
            - Y-axis: Labour income, capital income outside the business, Business Income, total income
            - Variants: Businesses that survive for at least 5 years vs everyone
            - Variants: Averages vs. Regression framework in Grant Application
        - Graph:
            - X-axis: percentile of labour market income (3 year average) prior to entrepreneurship
            - Y-axis: average percentile of entrepreneurial income post entrepreneurship (3 year average)
        - Table
            - What do entrepreneurs do after exiting a business: Return to labour market vs. new business vs. retire (0% in fake data) 
        - Graph: Exit
            - X-axis: Time before business formation {-3,-2,-1} and after business exit {1,2,3}
            - Y-axis: Labour income, capital income outside the business, total income
            - Variant: Businesses that survive for at least 5 years vs everyone
            - Variants: Averages vs. Regression framework in Grant Application
